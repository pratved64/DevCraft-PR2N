[@serwist/next] WARNING: You are using '@serwist/next' with `next dev --turbopack`, but it doesn't support Turbopack. Do one of the following:

- Set `disable` to `process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production"`.

- Use webpack by running `next dev --webpack` instead of `next dev --turbopack`.

- Migrate to '@serwist/turbopack' which has experimental support for Turbopack. See https://serwist.pages.dev/docs/next/turbo for more information.

- Migrate to configurator mode which has support for Turbopack. See https://serwist.pages.dev/docs/next/config for more information. 

Follow https://github.com/serwist/serwist/issues/54 for progress on Serwist + Turbopack. You can also suppress this warning by setting SERWIST_SUPPRESS_TURBOPACK_WARNING=1.

▲ Next.js 16.1.6 (Turbopack)

  Creating an optimized production build ...
⨯ ERROR: This build is using Turbopack, with a `webpack` config and no `turbopack` config.
   This may be a mistake.

   As of Next.js 16 Turbopack is enabled by default and
   custom webpack configurations may need to be migrated to Turbopack.

   NOTE: your `webpack` config may have been added by a configuration plugin.

   To configure Turbopack, see https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/turbopack

   TIP: Many applications work fine under Turbopack with no configuration,
   if that is the case for you, you can silence this error by passing the
   `--turbopack` or `--webpack` flag explicitly or simply setting an 
   empty turbopack config in your Next config file (e.g. `turbopack: {}`).
